# Description
This is a repository containing miscellaneous web development stuffs I test.  
And since I'm kinda lazy to cope with this I'ma leave it here for backups.

# Setup and Running
```
git clone https://github.com/Lapprealm/dev-test-ci ci
cd ci
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080
```
Or just clone this repo and put it in htdocs and make sure to change its local base url config.
